# Media-bias-Detection


This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting and quantifying media bias in text using a BERT model for sequence classification. The model is fine-tuned to predict bias scores on a scale of 0 to 10.

## Introduction

In the age of information, media bias can significantly influence public opinion. This project leverages the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to analyze text data and provide a bias score that reflects the degree of bias present in the content.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/media-bias-detection.git
cd media-bias-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
